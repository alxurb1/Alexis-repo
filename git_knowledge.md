## RESEARCH GIT BASICS

### **Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**

I have used git before, on a university project, It was a group project of developing and API for a cinema and we used the git tool to develop it, making to share our work parts easier. 

### **Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**

I have all variants of Git clients: the command line terminal, GUI Git tools, and the VS Code integrated Git client. The most useful for me is the VS Code integration because it makes it easier to visualize branches, clone repositories, create pull requests, and so on. I think thatâ€™s the most useful tool for me.

### **What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**

I learned about the uses of Git as a version control system, how to install it properly, and how to make commits and push changes.
