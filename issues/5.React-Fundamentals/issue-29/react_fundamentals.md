# ISSUE 29 Styling with Tailwind CSS

## REFLECTION

### What are the advantages of using Tailwind CSS?

One of the advantages of using Tailwind CSS instead of traditional CSS is that
we can save space and storage by having all the styles needed in one specific
file linked directly to the component. Less code makes it easier to maintain
later.

### What are some potential pitfalls?

The main pitfalls are that we can end up with very large class lists due to
Tailwind usage. Also, if we forget to use responsive classes like sm, md, or
lg, our content won't be responsive. Additionally, we can become overly
dependent on Tailwind, when not all components need a Tailwind class; some
shorter components may only need a small CSS file.
