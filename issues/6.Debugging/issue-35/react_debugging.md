# ISSUE 35 Research Best Debugging Techniques for React

## REFLECTIONS

### What are the most common debugging techniques?

The most common debugging techniques are using console logging, setting
breakpoints in the Visual Studio Code debugger, reading terminal error messages
and stack traces, and using the React DevTools, which is a widely adopted
debugging tool nowadays.

### Which tools are most effective for React debugging?

The most effective tools depend on the developer’s skills, preferences, and the
type of problem. For example, if it’s a frontend issue with a div or component,
the React DevTools can be a good option to determine the cause of the problem.

### How do you debug issues in large React codebases?

In large React codebases, I usually rely on the browser’s developer tools and
the React DevTools when the issue is related to the frontend. But if it’s a
backend or logic issue, I use the Visual Studio Code debugger or check the
terminal output, and then search for the error online if needed.
