# ISSUE 41 REFACTORING CODE FOR SIMPLICITY

## REFLECTION

### What made the original code complex?

The code returns the even numbers from a specific array, but it wasn’t
simple or easy to understand. It used a for loop with continue and an
extra array, when all of this could be done with less code and in a
clearer way.

### How did refactoring improve it?

Refactoring made the code easier to read and understand. It’s also shorter
and cleaner, which makes it more efficient and easier to use on any computer,
regardless of its resources.

## REFACTORING CODE EXAMPLE

[Unnecessarily Complicated Code](complicated_file.js)

[Refactored File](refactored_file.js)
