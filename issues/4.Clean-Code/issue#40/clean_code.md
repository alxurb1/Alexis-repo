# ISSUE 40 COMMENTING AND DOCUMENTATION

## REFLECTION

### When should you add comments?

We should add comments when the code’s understandability is critical for
the project, so everyone working on it knows what each function or class
does. This helps avoid misunderstandings and potential problems in the future.

### When should you avoid comments and instead improve the code?

When a function is short and easy to understand without comments, it’s better
to improve variable or constant names instead of adding extra comment lines.
This keeps the code clean and self-explanatory.
