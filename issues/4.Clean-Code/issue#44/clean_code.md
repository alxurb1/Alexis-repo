# ISSUE 44 NAMING VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS

## REFLECTIONS

### What makes a good variable or function name?

A good variable or function name should clearly describe its purpose in the
codebase. When working in teams, this is especially useful because teammates
can quickly understand what a piece of code does just by reading it.

### What issues can arise from poorly named variables?

Poorly named variables can cause misunderstandings. As mentioned, when working
in a team, clarity is crucial so that everyone can follow the code easily.
To avoid confusion and miscommunication, variables and functions should always
be named properly.

### How did refactoring improve code readability?

Refactoring improved code readability by making the code easier to understand.
This allows other programmers to quickly grasp what the code does, whether for
future modifications or simply for reviewing the codebase.
