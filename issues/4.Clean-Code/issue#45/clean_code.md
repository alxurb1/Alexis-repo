# ISSUE 45 CODE FORMATTING AND STYLE GUIDES

## REFLECTION

### Why is code formatting important?

Code formatting is important because it avoids future code issues, to work on a
team is important to all follow the same guide styles saving time and resources
and avoiding styling issues on the code.

### What issues did the linter detect?

The linter detected some issues with an example code I wrote, because I only
declared some variables without context, just to show how a specific feature
works.

### Did formatting the code make it easier to read?

Totally, reformatting the code made it easier to read, since the structure
looks more organized and consistent. It also helps to quickly spot mistakes
or areas that could be improved.
