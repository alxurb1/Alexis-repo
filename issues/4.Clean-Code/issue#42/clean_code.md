# ISSUE 42 AVOIDING CODE DUPLICATION

## REFLECTION

### What were the issues with duplicated code?

In theory, the functioning of that code is fine, but the main issue is
that some features could have been developed using fewer lines of code.
This keeps a cleaner structure and a more optimized codebase. Having
duplicated code should not happen because it makes the project harder
to manage.

### How did refactoring improve maintainability?

Refactoring improved maintainability by reducing the amount of code. With
fewer lines, there is less to maintain over time, which also means fewer
things to review or fix. In short, less code equals less complexity.
