# ISSUE #37 IDENTIFYING AND FIXING CODE SMELLS

## CODE SMELLS TESTING

[Code With Code Smells](code-smells-examples.js)

[Code Without Code Smells](code-smells-corrections.js)

## REFLECTIONS

### What code smells did you find in your code?

I intentionally did a code that has all the code smells as possible and then
I tried to fix them, using refactoring and logic thinking, but I realized that
my past codes had a los of deeply nested conditionals but nowadays I don't
make those mistakes.

### How did refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of the code?

Well refactoring improved readability and code maintainability by making the
code stronger and more effective, using good programming techniques and
avoiding future issues related to the code structure.

### How can avoiding code smells make future debugging easier?

Well, avoiding code smells will always make future debugging easier by
avoiding incorrect code structure, bad programming techniques and
unoptimized code, without all of these disadvantages, the code will
avoid problems making it easier to debug.
