# ISSUE 43 WRITING SMALLS, FOCUSED FUNCTIONS

## REFLECTION

### Why is breaking down functions beneficial?

Breaking down functions has a lot of benefits for our code, because
we optimize our code, optimize resources on the machine hosting the
code, making it lighter and more affordable for any device.

### How did refactoring improve the structure of the code?

Well, refactoring improved the structure of the code by separating functions
that were all in one, which is not something recommendable for code
performance improvement.

## SMALL AND FOCUSED FUNCTIONS EXAMPLES

[Long Function](longFunction.js)

[Refactored and Optimized Functions](refactoredFunction.js)
