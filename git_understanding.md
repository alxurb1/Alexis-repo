## REFLECTION

### Why are PRs important in a team workflow?

Pull Requests are an important part of team workflows because they help us organize our work and improve collaboration. A PR allows teammates to review the changes before merging them into the main branch, making sure the code is correct, follows best practices, and doesnâ€™t introduce errors.

### What makes a well-structured PR?

A well-structured PR must be clean and easy to others to understand it and review it, a well-structured PR must have, a clear title, a detailed description, labels to detail your work type, and the issue or task you worked on linked to the pull request.

### What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?

I learned how to create a proper Pull Request by providing full context of the work I did. I learned to include before and after videos or screenshots to give enough quality evidence of my changes. I also learned to add labels to the PR to specify the area or type of work I completed.
