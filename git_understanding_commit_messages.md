## REFLECTION

### What makes a good commit message?

A good commit message must capitalize the first word and not end with punctuation. It should include a detailed description of what was done, and a mood describing the type of commit, for example: Bugfix, Update, Refactor, and so on. A good commit message should be direct, eliminating filler words and phrases in sentences. We should think like journalists.

### How does a clear commit message help in team collaboration?

A clear commit message help enhance team collaboration by providing clear and concise information about changes to the codebase, allowing me and other teammates to quickly see what changes were made and why. A messy commit message slows everyone down, while a clean commit message saves time, reduces misunderstanding and builds trust in codebase.

### How can poor commit messages cause issues later?

As mentioned, a poor commit messages causes misunderstandings, creating a bad workflow, slowing down processes that should be done quickly, also a poor commit message causes difficulties to understand project history, if messages are vague, it'harder to know what changed without opening the code.
